# URTelegram - ESP32 Telegram bot

Initially intended as a fork of https://github.com/cotestatnt/AsyncTelegram but changes went too far and in quite a different direction, this bot is not intended for a typical bot applications with in-built keyboard and standard responses, instead it should be used as a free text communication tool. At the moment all text processing code is outside of the bot core - but eventually will be moved into it
